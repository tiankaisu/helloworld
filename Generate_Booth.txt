Generating DFG:
1.	Change booth source and TCL
2.	Run: hector -debug 2
3.	In other terminal: cd /debug
4.	~/booth_radix4_mult/debug>    cp ../SCV_WORK/MP_working_dir_<some number>/dfgs/seg1.dfg SCV_WORK/
5.	Run: hector -debug 2 -script run.tcl
6.	Inside SCV_WORK you will find bitdfg.dfg
7.	Then follow Himanshu’s instruction to convert DFG to Verilog

Converting:
In different directory,
1.	hector -debug 2
2.	readdfg /remote/us01home56/tiankas/booth_radix4_mult/debug/SCV_WORK/bitdfg.dfg -nowork
(it has to be the absolute directory, you should get a "1")
3.	writeverilog -module DFG2RTL -override booth_radix4_8.v
(you can also do statsdfg  # to see what operations are present in DFG. you should get a "1")
4.	cp /remote/vgsource11/tiankas/clients/client_hector_1/Source/scv/release/tutorial
